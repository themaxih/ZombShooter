v0.0.2 Additions

In this patch, I tried to adjust the difficulty of the game but it's really hard to correctly adjust it. I will continue to adjust the difficulty if I find more ideas to do it.
I also fixed some bugs and turned the game more funny to play.

- Removal of the "Ball Speed" increase, therefore increasing the base speed of the ball

- The "Move Speed" augment now has a max lvl (25)

- You can now reload whenever you want, but you can't shoot while reloading

- The "Capacity" augment no longer reloads the magazine

- Modification of the price system (from an arithmetic sequence to a geometric sequence) to make augments less easy to buy

- Adjusted zombie spawn time to make the game harder as the game progresses

- Added a new zombie, the spitter

- Added a custom icon on the desktop
